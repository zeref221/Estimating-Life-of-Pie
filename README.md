# Estimating-Life-of-Pie

Here we estimate value of pi by throwing darts

1. We start by taking a square of length 1 cm
2. Then we draw a circle of radius 1 such that it fits the square
3. The number of darts inside the circle 
> = Darts in circle/darts in square = pi/4
5. So, if we multiply the LHS by 4 we can get the value of pi.
> So, 4*(Darts in circle/darts in square) = pi
7. Once we simulate this over a number of iterations, we can get fairly accurate estimate of pi value upto 4 decimals
8. This is called the monte carlo method.
